# 🏥 Disease Predictor Web Application

A **full-stack web application** that predicts possible diseases based on user-entered symptoms. The project uses a **React.js frontend**, a **Flask (Python) backend**, and **MongoDB** for data storage. It demonstrates real-world usage of Machine Learning concepts combined with modern web technologies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Disease Predictor** allows users to enter symptoms through a clean web interface. These symptoms are sent to a Flask API, where a machine learning model processes the input and predicts the most likely disease. The result is then displayed back to the user in real time.
